## Lab V: Sorting
There is an object called ```DLine``` which is represented as a dashed-line with *n* dashes, where *n* can be specified as the class field called ```length```.
Using this object, we can create a list of ```DLine```s of different ```length```s. We use such lists to practice sorting.  

### Objectives:
* We want to implement three simple sort algorithms by following their pseudo codes instead of knowing their names.
* We then visualize the steps of sorting and try to tell what sort method we just implemented.
* At the end, we run some experiments to observe some of the strengths and weaknesses.
